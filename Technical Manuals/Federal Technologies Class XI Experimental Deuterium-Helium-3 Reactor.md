# Working
The Federal Technologies Class XI Experimental Deuterium-Helium-3 Reactor, henceforth referred to as the EDH3, is an experimental Main Reactor unit designed for use on medium-size, high-power vessels.

It employs the familiar Fusion process, but with Deuterium and Helium-3 as fuel, instead of Deuterium and Tritium. The temperatures involved are much higher, and the containment more difficult.

# Procedures
## Cold Start
### 1. Injectors
Initialise and prime Deuterium and Helium-3 injectors.
### 2. Coolant System
Start pumps and compressors.
Wait for coolant temperature to reach 56.7 Kelvin.
Ensure temperature, pressure, and flow are within specification.
### 3. Burn Control
Enable Burn Control.
Ensure base calibration is within specification.
Disable variable injector control.
### 4. Exhaust Control
Enable Exhaust Control.
Ensure no blockages are present.
### 5. Magnetic Containment
Enable Magnetic Containment.
Enable Variable Containment.
### 5. Pre-heat Reaction Chamber
Wait for Reaction Chamber to reach 15 million degrees Kelvin.
### 6. Start
Set Burn Control to 100% for 3 seconds.
Set Burn Control to 15%.
Monitor statistics for anomalies.
Enable variable injector control.
## Shutdown
### 1. Lower Output
Gradually lower output to 0.1%.
### 2. Purge Reaction Chamber
Set output to 0%.
Purge Chamber through Exhaust.
### 3. Disable all other systems
Disable all other systems one-by-one.
## Emergency Shutdown
### 1. Lower Output
Lower output to below 80%.
### 2. Purge Reaction Chamber
Set output to 0%.
Purge Chamber through Exhaust.
Warning: Excessive use will cause heavy damage to reactor.
### 3. Disable all other systems
Disable all other systems one-by-one.
