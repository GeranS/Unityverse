# Species of the Federation
## Founding Members
### Krozek
Homeworld: Rotherlan, a mountainous world that spends approximately three thirds of the local year frozen.  
Appearance: The average Krozek stands, on average, 8 feet tall, and are much bulkier than humans, on account of being made of stone. They traditionally engrave glowing lines throughout their component stone as a rite of passage, with the colour of the line varying by clan; and adults will engrave runes into their body to honour important life events. Krozek have differing sexes, though to most non-Krozek, it is difficult to tell the difference.  
  
Rothelan is a harsh world. In their history, Krozek clans would fight often for resources, absorbing the survivors into a larger clan, until a group would eventually split off to hunt for better resources elsewhere. Even post-unification, Krozek society is still heavily based around the clans, where every member is free to have their voice heard. Clans, on average, consist of between 50 - 100 members, though outliers exist.  
  
Unsurprisingly, considering the need to survive on a hostile world, Krozek culture is militaristic, and they are renowned as some of the best soldiers in the Federation, as well as some of the best commanders, due to their willingness to hear out the thoughts of their soldiers. Krozek are also rather Xenophilic, allowing any sapient to be inducted into a clan, with several notable clan leaders post-Federation having been non-Krozek. A stereotype in the Federation is that Krozek are slow to act and ponderous, which like all stereotypes, does have a pebble of truth to it - Krozek society is a bit slower paced, with formal name readings tending to last long, and Clan Councils often involving weeks of debate and discussion.

### Stenkrax
Homeworld: Athrax, a barren desert wasteland.  
Appearance: Stenkrax are large non-humanoid insectoid creatures, walking on four legs, and with three fingered hands. Their exo-skeleton is obsidian black, leaving them hard to differentiate to most non-Stenkrax (though most will be able to recognize ones they’re familiar with). Stenkrax are a mono gendered species, and the majority are somewhat neutral towards the concept of pronouns used by other beings, though a rare few will stick to one set of pronouns for themselves.  
  
Life in Athrax has always been difficult. Cults and monarchs fighting each other for dominance, enslaving the survivors and laying eggs in the fallen (something which is not at all genetically necessary). Then, arose a prophet known as Morariu the Wise, who spread a new philosophy, one of non-violence, of acceptance, of questioning the world. As this belief spread, Athrax changed - it was still a desolate waste, but Stenkrax were working to make society not horrible.  
  
Between their philosophical outlook, and the societal interest in pacifism and equality, Stenkrax make up a large portion of Federation statespeople, politicians, and political theorists - in fact, Stenkrax have the honour of being the species to have the most Federation presidents (including the first president, Petrescu). Despite this, Stenkrax are the least common founding species in terms of celebrities, due to their strangeness and difficulties for the layperson in differentiating them.

### Kal-if-fee
Homeworld: Amok, a dry yet temperate world with cities centered around oases.  
Appearance: The Kal-if-fee are oddly humanlike in appearances, with a few exceptions. Their ears are pointed, and they have a striped pattern that starts below the ears and continues down the back of their shoulders.  
  
The Kal-if-fee society is deeply rooted in traditionalism and rituals, though they display little of this outwardly. They get along well with humans, and are often mistaken for humans by those unaware of their existence.  
  
The Kal-if-fee follow the guidance of the Enlightened, a small group of individuals who are susceptible to Tugharge, a rare substance that when injected can give some individuals control of the Quantum Reality Field. This gives the individual magic-like powers, at the cost of becoming addicted to the substance, and suffering from poor health if not managed properly.  
  
This magic can be of all different sorts, but any individual will only ever receive one type of gift.  
  
Kal-if-fee rituals generally involve inhaling, ingesting, or injecting miniscule amounts of Tugharge. This influences the Quantum Reality Field around them, improving its quality for being harnessed by the Enlightened.  
  
The Kal-if-fee love to experiment, learn, and teach, and many in their society spend their days doing these things.

### Humans
Homeworld: Earth, which is exactly like you expect.  
  
Of the five founding races of the Federation, humans have the distinction of being the first to discover FTL, though the other four would do the same within 15 Federation Standard years. As a result of this head start, Humans are currently the most widespread of Federation species, with one of the largest populations.  
  
Humanity has proven to be adaptable to most climates, in part due to their skill with cybernetic, biological, and genetic modification. Human culture, unlike most other Federation species, has never really unified, and thus they can be said to be the most diverse of the Federation (this is, of course, not to imply that all other species have a unified culture, which is false - however, the difference is much more notable in humans).

### Khowl'Bolls
Homeworld: Windfall, a world that consists primarily of water, with many islands (none of which are larger than Sicily).  
Appearances: Short and reptilian, resembling wingless dragon people. Scales come in a variety of colours.  
  
Despite hailing from the aquatic world Windfall, Khowl’Bolls are notably incapable of breathing underwater, necessitating the development of a strong seafaring culture, a common thread of wanderlust, and a proclivity for trade between islands.  
  
Due to seafaring being such an integral part of Khowl’Boll society, they are considered to be expert shipbuilders, with three of the five largest shipyards in the Federation being within their territory. Additionally, a large part of the Federation’s merchant fleet is composed of Khowl’Boll vessels, resulting in a sizable minority of their population having never lived on a planet for a prolonged amount of time.

## Minor Species
All species prior to this are the founding members of the Federation. They control the majority of Federation space, in no small part due to just having more time to expand. All species past this point are minor, and control a few planets - rarely more than three notable ones. All Federation species are completely equal, and all are valued members. Feel free to create minor species if you have ideas.
### Nepenthe
Homeworld: Nepenthe, once an Earthlike world, the death of their creators and invasion by the Tea;Lant has left the planet heavily scarred and damaged.  
Appearance: Being a race of Sapient AI in robot bodies, the appearance of an individual Nepenthe varies greatly, but they all have obviously mechanical bodies.  
  
Originally, the Nepenthe were non-sapient AI, used by their creators to perform physical labour as they lived in a peaceful utopia. Life on the world was perfect. Until the plague struck. Within a year, their creators were wiped out, and Nepenthe was left empty, with naught but robots continuing their routine, working to fuel a society that no longer existed.  
  
And then, after hundreds of years, something changed. One bot, a custodian of a long-abandoned office building, developed sapience. Soon after, an automated police unit half a continent away would do the same. Almost overnight, the robotic population of Nepenthe achieved sapience. Modelling their society off of their creators, the Nepenthe would soon take to the stars, to see if there was other life out there.

### Ōkina-Washi
Homeworld: Nesuto, a subtropical world, where all landmass consists of floating islands lifted by an element dubbed “Suspendium” by Federation scientists. Below the islands, the rest of the world consists of ocean and ice, most of which has not been explored.  
Appearance: Resembling the falcons of Earth, the Ōkina-Washi are rather slender, and capable of flight. Though more fragile than humans, they have much better eyesight.  
  
Though the majority of Federation members have some form of democratic government, there are exceptions. The Enlightened Empire of Nesuto is a small three system nation, ruled by a benevolent Emperor, who is charged with leading the nation and ensuring the safety and liberty of their people. Though the governance of the Empire is managed by the Emperor and their council, a Citizens Parliament exists, to ensure the citizenry have some way to raise issues, and to ensure their needs are met.  
  
Honour is an important concept in Ōkina-Washi society, from the poorest citizen to the Emperor themself, with anyone who repeatedly proves to be dishonourable being seen as a great villain. As a result, it is not unheard of for Ōkina-Washi leaders to butt heads with other Federation leaders over matters of honour, even as the Ōkina-Washi stay committed to the ideals of the Federation.
