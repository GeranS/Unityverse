# Tugharge
Tugharge is a metallic-like substance that is found naturally in limited quantities on several planets and asteroids. Weak, ductile, rare, and very sensitive to changes in temperature, it is useless for any structural purposes, and its electrical properties make it unattractive for use in electronics. For years it was considered the most worthless metal in existence, until the Kal-if-fee informed the rest of the Federation of its hidden properties soon after the formation of the Federation.
## How to use Tugharge
Tugharge is either injected or ingested. Limited dosage is advised, but it is rare that too much causes long-term negative effects.
## The Quantum Reality Field
The Quantum Reality Field is an energy field that runs throughout the entire universe along with the regular Quantum Field. It’s often referred to as “magical energy” or the “soul plane”, though neither of those statements are entirely scientifically accurate.
## Effects
Tugharge has no major effect on the majority of the population. The Kal-if-fee make use of the minor effects in rituals, which “heal” or “strengthen” the local Quantum Reality Field. In roughly one in a million people, it has stronger effects. These effects vary wildly, and the details are nearly unique to each person. Some can see the future, some can see the past, some control fire, lightning.  
  
Each person can only have one of these powers, and they can never change their power. The one they get is the one they will have forever. Note that these powers can only be used if they have sufficient Tugharge in their bloodstream.
