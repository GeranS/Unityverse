The Tea;Lant Noble Republic is a militaristic empire to the Northeast of the Federation, and the two powers have been foes since before the Federationâ€™s formation. In the Republic, only Nobility are allowed to vote, with lesser citizens having only limited rights - Tea;Lant having better rights than non-Tea;Lant, but not by much.

  

Currently, the Tea;Lant Noble Republic is dealing with a rebellion of Brue;Frain. Brue;Frain is a set of two systems, with a total of six habitable worlds. A combination of factors have resulted in the population of the systems to be very different from the core Tea;Lant worlds. Tired of Tea;Lant oppression, the six worlds have united in rebellion against their overworlds. Ever since the first conflict in 2210, the planets have housed large permanent military garrisons. While there is currently no ongoing conflict, the peace is fragile and life for the locals is difficult.

  

Several organisations still maintain official and unofficial weapon stockpiles and armed forces.
