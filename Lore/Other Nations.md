## Tea;Lant Noble Republic

The Tea;Lant Noble Republic is a militaristic empire to the Northeast of the Federation, and the two powers have been foes since before the Federationâ€™s formation. In the Republic, only Nobility are allowed to vote, with lesser citizens having only limited rights - Tea;Lant having better rights than non-Tea;Lant, but not by much.

  

Currently, the Tea;Lant Noble Republic is dealing with a rebellion of Brue;Frain. Brue;Frain is a set of two systems, with a total of six habitable worlds. A combination of factors have resulted in the population of the systems to be very different from the core Tea;Lant worlds. Tired of Tea;Lant oppression, the six worlds have united in rebellion against their overworlds. Ever since the first conflict in 2210, the planets have housed large permanent military garrisons. While there is currently no ongoing conflict, the peace is fragile and life for the locals is difficult.

  

Several organisations still maintain official and unofficial weapon stockpiles and armed forces.

## The United and Sovereign Dominions of Arrett and Carraya

The United and Sovereign Dominions of Arrett and Carraya is the most isolationist nation known to exist. Very little is known about them, and in the limited amount of encounters the Federation has had with them, their ships always preferred to either flee or directly engage in combat.  
  

### The Government
As it is presently understood, the government consists of a Diarchy of indirectly elected monarchs with a large amount of councils to assist them.
#### The Diarch of Arrett
The Diarch of Arrett is appointed by the Arrett Council of Continuation. This council has, as far as we know, 11 members. Each member of the council is appointed by a separate Regional Council of Arrett, which each consist of between 175 and 700 elected representatives.  
  
Interestingly, each planet in the nation has 11 of these regions, and each region corresponds to one on Arrett. This means that, in practice, there are 11 regional governments, which each govern a chunk of land on all planets within the empire.
#### The Diarch of Carraya
The Diarch of Carraya is appointed by the Carrayan Committee on Matters of Succession. The Committee consists of 3 elected members, 6 members appointed by the previous Diarch of Carraya, and 14 members appointed by the Divine Carrayan Church.  
  
The Diarch of Carraya appoints a spiritual leader to each planet, called a Syram. The Syram of a planet guides the inhabitants of the planet spiritually, appointing various "Sub-Syrams" (of which we do not know the real name), to assist locally.
