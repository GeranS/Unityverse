# Planets of the Federation
## Unity - Unity System
In the Federation, there are two notable places named Unity - the station, a colossal habitat that houses the government facilities of the Federation and serves as the capital; and the planet, a gaia world which the station orbits, originally colonized by the various Federation races to serve for infrastructure and support for the station, which later developed its own culture and traditions.
## Earth - Sol System
It's fuckin' Earth, ecological damage has been repaired, and things are nice. Yay. (France sustained heavy damage though, which is why things are nice).
## Mars - Sol System
Due to its proximity to Earth, and being judged the safer choice compared to Luna (if something goes horribly wrong, it won’t cause heavy damage to their homeworld), Mars was Humanity’s first attempt at terraforming, an attempt at making a second Earth within their home system. Things went poorly.  
   
Mars is now a world of ash and flame, covered in volcanoes and lava. Once known as the Red Planet, now the world is stained black and grey. Despite this, colonization efforts still happened, with many living in dome cities, leaving them in protective gear for mining operations, or to use the lava flows to fuel the forges and shipyards. It is often easy to discern metal forged on Mars, due to the black tint inherent to the world.  
  
Life on Mars is, at times, difficult. However, the domes themselves are quite nice, and safety measures do exist to protect workers outside of them. Furthermore, though augmentation is not unheard of among humans, it is fairly prominent in the culture of the world - most commonly, modifications to be able to survive outside of domes without protective gear - a trio of augmentations to the skin to resist the extreme heat, the lungs to be able to filter out the ash, and the eyes to see through the smoke and flame.  
## Herekore - Llyke System
A Tepui world a couple jumps away from Earth, Herekore was originally colonized by a combination of American, Pacific and African Indigenous cultures - though as with most Federation worlds, a wide variety of cultures and species can be found residing on the world. With most of the world's lower altitudes covered in fog, the majority of the population resides on the mesas and plateaus of the world. Due to the fog cover below the mesas, hover racing is a popular sport on Herekore, and many pilots get their start flying in the mist.  
  
Most of the land below the mesas is unexplored, being difficult to navigate and with many exotic species - carnivorous flora and dinosaur-like species having been some of the few discoveries observed below - and rumours exist of ancient ruins belonging to a precursor species, though the Federation has yet to discover any concrete evidence.
## Rothelan - Roth System
Rothelan is a world of mountains, orbiting far from its sun. The Rothelan year lasts approximately 800 Earth standard days, 600 of which it spends frozen. As a result, there are few above-ground settlements still existing, with most being built into the mountains. Due to the vast amount of ruins to be found on the surface, and the equatorial regions being similar in climate to the Swiss Alps, there is a small but notable tourism industry.
## Reorus - Roth System
The moon of Rothlean, a Highland world, Reorus served as a bulwark during the First Tea;Lant War, being built up as a rallying point, as a fortification network, and as a training camp; preparing Alliance forces for battle. Though it faced a couple invasions, and many more fleet battles, the flag of the Krozek never fell from the planet’s surface.  
  
In modern times, Reorus continues to serve as one of the main military complexes in the Federation, with many units passing through “Camp Stone” as it has been nicknamed. The civilian population of Reorus is similarly hardened by all the conflict, and many hold a strong sense of patriotism for the Federation, as without the Alliance of Five Peoples, the world would have fallen.
## Athrax - Cippe System
Athrax was never a pleasant world - even as Morariu’s creed managed to save the Stenkrax from themselves, it was still barren, boiling, and covered in ruins. In the centuries leading up to the discovery of space travel, Athrax saw a new age: one where ruined cities were rebuilt, new homes were made, routes for travel were planned out. Though Athrax is still a desert, it has a certain charm, and a joint Stenkrax-Human research project has resulted in many major cities having climates similar to Unity, though the rest of the world is still quite hostile to most species.
## Arrkku V - Arrkku System
An Outback world, Arrkku V is hot and dry, though compared to Athrax, it is much more tolerable to most species. Orbiting the brightest star in the Athraxian sky, many of the religions and philosophies held Arrkku as important, and thus, the world is a cultural beacon for the Insectoid beings. Some of the greatest Stenkrax art and music originates from the world, with films from the planet being renowned through the Federation.
## Amok - Kal-toh System
Amok is the home planet of the Kal-if-fee. It is a dry yet temperate world with large cities centered around oases.  
  
The Kal-if-fee were long restricted to a small area of the planet with bountiful water supply, as they were insufficiently technologically advanced to carry enough supplies to reach far away oases. This has resulted in one area of the planet being densely populated, with many very old cities, with the oldest still surviving buildings being up to 3500 years old. The rest of the planet is more sparsely populated, and has far fewer old buildings.  
  
Once advanced irrigation technology was discovered, the planet experienced a boom in population. The previously uninhabitable land between oases became rich farmland, able to support a large population.
## Windfall - Hōkū System
Windfall is the homeworld of the Khowl’Boll, where over 95% of the planet’s surface is underwater, with the remaining five percent consisting of tropical islands, atolls, and archipelagos. Warm, wet, and sunny year round, Windfall is a popular travel destination for many Federation species. Due to the limited amount of space on the planet, the late 2160’s saw the construction of an orbital ring around the world, acting as a trade hub, a colossal shipyard, and a capital city for the planet.  
  
Alongside Khowl’Boll’s, the other notable species to live on Windfall are the Deragona, a species similar to the dragons of Earth myth. Though it is still debated if Deragona are sapient, they are quite intelligent, and it’s not unheard of for smaller ones to be treated as employees in shops, providing work in exchange for food and affection. Meanwhile, the largest Deragona are worshipped as gods and guardians of the islands and their people.
## ʻĀina Hou - Honua System
A Mangrove world, ʻĀina Hou orbits around a gas giant (ʻĀina), and has a thriving orbital mining industry, mining its fellow moons and ʻĀina’s rings, as well as collecting exotic gases from the giant. As a result of this industry, ʻĀina Hou maintains the third largest shipyards in the Federation, after Windfall and Mars.
## Nepenthe - Epoch System
Nepenthe is a world not unlike Earth, in terms of climate. However, due to the centuries between the death of their creators and the Nepenthe achieving sapience, as well as the prolonged conflict with the Tea;Lant, the planet has many scars, and even though it has rebuilt, the legacy of the past is still prominent.
## Nesuto - Hoshi System
Nesuto is often considered to be one of, if not the most beautiful worlds in the Federation, on account of the naturally floating islands. Due to the Ōkina-Washi being naturally capable of flight, roads exist primarily for pedetrestian use, with airships and skiffs being used for long distance travel. Between the lack of heavily polluting vehicles, and the inability to build overly heavy infrastructure on the islands, Nesuto has seen little pollution, and even with modern technology to repair environmental damage, it still may be the most pristine world in the Federation. Unsurprisingly, it is a very popular tourist destination.
