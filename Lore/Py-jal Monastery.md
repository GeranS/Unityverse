# Py-jal Monastery
The Py'Jal Monastery was founded by the Py-jal group of Kal-if-fee spirituals in 2145. 
## The Py-jal
The Py-jal are a Kal-if-fee spiritual movement and group centered around the idea of attaining Enlightened status through sheer strength of will and perseverance. They believe that Enlightened are superior to non-Enlightened and that any person, specifically any Kal-if-fee, can become an Enlightened should they have the strength.  
  
The movement is strongly isolationist, believing most contact with the outside world to be too distracting from their ultimate goal of achieving Enlightened status.
## The Monastery
The Monastery itself is very much alike monasteries found on Amok or other primarily Kal-if-fee worlds. It contains a circular central meditation and prayer space with several other buildings standing nearby it, forming a sort of star when viewed from above.  
  
The Monastery is the center-point of the planet, which dedicates much of its efforts to maintaining and expanding the Monastery.
## The Planet
The planet, also named Py-jal, is a mostly arid planet with a very gentle and temperate climate. Most towns and villages are concentrated around a region with multiple lakes and a relatively stable supply of fresh water.  
Py-jal receives occasional shipments of equipment that can't be manufactured on the planet itself.
