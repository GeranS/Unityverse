# Piracy in the Federation
This document outlines the types of pirates within the Federation and their modes of operation.

## Type 1 Pirates
Type 1 Pirates are pirates which originated within the Federation and use mostly Federation technology. Their ships are old civilian ships, either stolen or recovered from scrapyards. They retrofit these ships with new guns, shield generators, engines, and occasionally auxiliary reactors. Replacing or upgrading either the main reactor or warp drive is generally not within their capabilities, and the ship's reliability suffers massively as a result.

## Type 2 Pirates
Type 2 Pirates pilot the same ships as Type 1 Pirates, but differ in their equipment. They are far more likely to have made extensive upgrades to ship systems, and are known to also expand or up-armour hulls. They are capable of replacing the reactor and warp drive, and their ships are far more reliable.  
  
These pirates are often found with equipment from outside the Federation, oftentimes Tea;Lant surplus or Onselen discount equipment.

## Type 3 Pirates
Type 3 Pirates originate from outside the Federation, and typically possess the most powerful and modern pirate ships. While often still a few decades out of date, the better Type 3 pirates can pose a serious danger to Frigates and even some light Destroyers.  
  
Their ships and equipment can originate from anywhere, though Onselen equipment is very common.
