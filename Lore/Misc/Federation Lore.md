## Fedvision
Somewhat early in the Federations lifespan, there was a decision to form an annual musical contest, where each planet would send in an artist or group to perform a song, with the idea behind this being that it'll help national unity.  
Despite accusations of bias towards certain candidates and heated debates between fans, it remained very popular and is certainly here to stay.
