# Py'Jal Monastery
The Py'Jal Monastery was founded by the Py-jal group of Kal-if-fee spirituals in 2145. 
## The Py-jal
The Py-jal are a Kal-if-fee spiritual movement and group centered around the idea of attaining Enlightened status through sheer strength of will and perseverance. They believe that Enlightened are superior to non-Enlightened and that any person, specifically any Kal-if-fee, can become an Enlightened should they have the strength.  
  
The movement is strongly isolationist, believing most contact with the outside world to be too distracting from their ultimate goal of achieving Enlightened status.
## The Monastery
The Monastery itself is very much alike monasteries found on Amok or other primarily Kal-if-fee worlds. It contains a circular central meditation and prayer space with several other buildings standing nearby it, forming a sort of star when viewed from above.  
  
The Monastery is likely to be atypical if ever visited, however. Due to the isolationist nature of the Py-jal, the Monastery does not receive support from nearby villages like most do. The Monastery will therefore likely feature additional buildings and facilities necessary to their survival on the planet.
