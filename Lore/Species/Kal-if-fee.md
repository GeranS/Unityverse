# Kal-if-fee

## Homeworld: Amok

Amok is a dry yet temperate world with cities centered around oases.

## Appearance

The Kal-if-fee are oddly humanlike in appearances, with a few exceptions. Their ears are pointed, and they have a striped pattern that starts below the ears and continues down the back of their shoulders.

## Culture

Kal-if-fee culture is based around two core principles; the quest for knowledge and self-improvement, and the guidance of the Enlightened.

  

Many Kal-if-fee work as researchers or educators. They seek to learn more and spread that knowledge among everyone within the Federation. Their efforts are assisted and occasionally guided by the Enlightened.

## Enlightened

The Enlightened are a very small group of Kal-if-fee who have been given powers by the use of Tugharge, a rare mineral. Any Kal-if-fee who is known to have an affinity for the Quantum Reality Field is given access to the best educational facilities on Amok and the various Enlightened Monasteries.

  

Each Enlightened has a “gift”, a power they can use when they inject Tugharge into their body. Each Enlightened can only have one gift, and it cannot be changed. These gifts have a very wide range of effects and uses. Enlightened who may have gifts related to things like lightning, electricity, weather, or materials often use this to aid themselves or others in research. Some Enlightened may even be able to see the future in vague terms, and seek to guide Kal-if-fee society as a whole. These Enlightened form the spiritual core of Kal-if-fee society, though they do not enjoy any excessive preferential treatment.

## Naming

Kal-if-fee have a first name, a surname, and a surname prefix which indicates their gender. The surname may either be a more modern family name, or a more traditional clan name.

The surname prefix has five variants, all indicating the gender identity of the person. 

-   Zhen (prefix zh’). This is roughly the same as the gender female for humans.
    
-   Shen (prefix sh’). This is close to the gender female for humans, but more androgynous.
    
-   Zhan (prefix zha’). Zhan has two meanings, it’s used both for an androgynous identity and gender fluid.
    
-   Chan (prefix ch’). This is close to the gender male for humans, but more androgynous.
    
-   Thaan (prefix th’). This is roughly the same as the gender male for humans.
