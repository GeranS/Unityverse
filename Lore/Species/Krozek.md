# Krozek

## Homeworld: Rothelan

A mountainous world that spends approximately three thirds of the local year frozen

  

## Appearance

The average Krozek stands, on average, 8 feet tall, and are much bulkier than humans, on account of being made of stone. Krozek have differing sexes, though for most non-Krozek, it is difficult to tell the difference.

  

## Szertartás

Szertartás is the term used for two traditional elements of Krozek culture - ritual markings, done in the traditional colours of a Clan, and engraved as a rite of passage; and runes, which tell of important life events - battles, marriages, achievements, etc - and are engraved in a special language where every line is meant to tell a story.

  

## Clans

One of the most important concepts in Krozek society is the Clans - extended family units of, on average, 50 - 100 people. Traditionally, joining a Clan is done in a few ways - a member of another Clan defeated in battle may join the victors; someone who lost or left their Clan may petition to join another Clan; a marriage between members of different Clans will see one joining the other; a non-Clan member may be given an offer to join a clan in recognition of some deed; and a non-Clan member may request to join a Clan. Some Clans may make those who wish to join perform some trials, but it varies on a Clan by Clan basis. In any case, if someone joins a Clan, their family is also allowed to join if they so wish.

  

In a Clan, every generation is regarded as siblings, even if there is no blood relation. Within a Clan, all members are considered equal, and are allowed to speak their voice on matters that affect both them, and the whole Clan. Each Clan is led by a Speaker, chosen by the Clan members. They are then advised by a council of the Eldest members, as well as those who are familiar with relevant topics. The Speaker serves as the voice of the Clan in meetings of Clans, including the Clan Council - a meeting of all Speakers and their advisors on a World, to discuss matters that affect them all - these Councils take place every few years, and last for about a Month on average.

  

To be Clanless in Krozek society once meant death - with no soul to turn to in the winters of Rothelan, few were capable of surviving for long. In modern days, where non-Krozek live in the society, there are now several kinds of Clanless, some viewed better than others.

-   Száműzetés, an exile - someone cast out from their Clan for some great sin or betrayal. Their markings have their colour removed, and they are cast out from society to live in the wilds. Száműzetés are viewed with scorn, and even when allowed to stay within society, the majority of Krozek have no trust for them.
    
-   Leszármazott, a descendant - either descended from someone who left or lost a Clan and has not rejoined one, someone who willingly left a Clan, often due to personal differences; or more rarely, a child of a Száműzetés conceived after their exile. In either case, a Leszármazott is treated the same as a Krozek from another Clan, and any who wish to petition to join a Clan will oft be allowed to join, with the agreement that whatever deeds their ancestors may have performed need not be the sins of the Leszármazott. 
    
-   Szoliter, the lost - someone who lost their Clan, be it to battle, disease, or something else; and who has refused to join another Clan, deciding to live as the last (or one of the last) of their Clan, despite the inability to rebuild. Szoliter are viewed by most Krozek with a mixture of sadness, respect, and pity; and some of the greatest artists in the past ages of the Krozek have been Szoliter.
    
-   Kívülálló, the outsider - a non-Krozek who is not a member of a Clan, and has no aspiration to join a Clan. Kívülálló are viewed well by Krozek - the vast majority of the Federation being of this category - and Krozek worlds maintain a Kívülálló Council dedicated to protecting the rights of the Kívülálló, and finding out their needs to be brought to the Clans. 
    
-   Törekvő, the aspirant - a non-Krozek who wishes to join a Clan. A Törekvő often has some connection to a Clan member, and will often have to perform some trials to be allowed to join a Clan. How a Törekvő is viewed varies by Krozek to Krozek, as well by how familiar the Törekvő is to the Clan they wish to join. 
    

  

## Names

Krozek names have four elements to them: their birth name, the personal name, any given names, and their Clan name

-   Birth name, comparable to a first name - this name is given by parents, and is the main name used
    
-   Personal name, comparable to a middle name - this name is chosen by a Krozek upon gaining their Szertartás, and is used in places where most species would use a surname
    
-   Given names, comparable to titles - these names are awarded by Clanmates, often as recognition of a notable deed or trait. The amount of given names a Krozek has is a great way to judge their age & importance
    
-   Clan name, comparable to a surname - this is the name of a Krozek’s Clan, and due to its importance, is important to introductions and formalities
    

Example: Behrends Vezető “The Mountain’s Voice” of Clan Valgeir
