# First Mate 2119-10-24
At 17:44 on the 24th of October 2119 we encountered a distress signal on our way to Border Station L1 near the Unyielding Expanse. We adjusted course to inspect, and found the wreck of the FNV Ostoris, split in half. 
  
A boarding party consisting of Lieutenant-Commander th'Kallabax, Lieutenant Cathe zh'Batul, Sergeant Ani Enoka, and 19 marines boarded the ship to look for survivors.  
  
One life sign was detected in one of the aft cargo bays. Upon inspection the team found a neo-human by the name of Momifyn, who had the appearance of a mermaid. She was recovered and brought back to the Unity. The ship's logs and black box were also recovered.  
  
Upon inspection of the damage and the logs, the team aboard the Unity concluded that the FNV Ostoris was destroyed and looted by pirates. No other survivors were found, all 16 crew having lost their lives.
