Named after the star system of Epsilon Eridani where the first ships were built, the Eridanus-class and its successor variants make up most of the Federal Navyâ€™s frigates. Hyperion Heavy Industries designed the superstructure of the Eridanus to be modular and easily upgradable, capable of mounting a variety of different modules and weapons. These frigates are capable of performing a wide variety of independent missions ranging from long-range strike missions, deep-system reconnaissance, support for special operations forces, and escort missions. Eridanus-class frigates are often formed up with corvettes in Fast Reaction Flotillas, or are attached to Carrier Battle Groups to act as picket and scouting ships. 

  

The latest version of the Eridanus is the Eridanus-C variant, which boasts improved shields, avionics, thrusters, and room for a dual-barrel spinal-mount main weapon. The C-variant also comes with additional internal heatsinks, which allows the C-variant to sustain heavier rates of weapons fire before overheating, or dump excess heat into to reduce its thermal signature. Hyperion Heavy Industries is currently working on a D-variant to the Eridanus which will incorporate an improved version of the stealth-coating currently in use on the Normandy-class corvettes.
