## Description
To distinguish between Mars Shipyards and Mars the planet would be largely incorrect, as the whole planet is dedicated to supporting the shipyard and spaceship construction. Materials are mined, refined, and then turned into starship sub-systems on the planet surface, and then transported into orbit for the shipyards to use.  
  
Both Military and Civilian vessels are produced here in large quantities.  
### Mars Scrapyard
Mars also has a scrapyard, where old decommissioned Military and Civilian vessels are brought to be disassembled. Parts and materials are then either sold or further disassembled to be used in new manufacturing.  
  
Most ships of the Munckall√≥-Class ended up at the Mars Scrapyard, sitting partially disassembled, with some still in use as tugs.
