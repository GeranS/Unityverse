# Normandy-Class
## Description
Builders: Solar General Industries 
Operators: Federal navy
Built: 2208-Present
In Service: 2210-Present

  

With the first ships leaving the SolSys Ganymede shipyards in 2210, the Normandy-class incorporates some of the latest advances in avionics, sensors, and fusion drive technology. More notably, the Normandy-class is the first class of warship within the Federal navy to incorporate stealth technology to a significant degree, featuring numerous inbuilt thermal heatsinks to mask its infrared signature, and an integrated matte-black stealth coating on its hull to reduce its radar cross-section. The Normandy-classâ€™s stealth features, excellent sensor systems, agility and speed make it an excellent scouting and escort ship, and Normandy-class corvettes now form an integral part of any Federal carrier battle group.
